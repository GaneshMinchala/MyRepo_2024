If you have already added your SSH key to your GitHub account, you can switch from HTTPS to SSH for your existing repository by changing the remote URL. To do this, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal and navigate to your local repository directory.
Run the command git remote -v to see the current remote URL. It should start with https://.
Run the command git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo.git, where user and repo are the appropriate values for your GitHub username and repository name. This will change the remote URL to use SSH instead of HTTPS1.
Run the command git push -u origin master to push your changes to the remote repository using SSH. You may need to enter the passphrase for your SSH key if you have set one.
You can also verify that the remote URL has been changed by running git remote -v again. It should now start with git@github.com. For more information, see this article.

I hope this helps you to connect and push your commits to your remote repository with SSH. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
